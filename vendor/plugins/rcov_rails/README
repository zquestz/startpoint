RcovRails
=========

A simple "no thoughts required" solution to adding RCOV code coverage to your Rails application.
Just install the plugin, install the RCOV gem, and you're done.
Enjoy.

Example
=======

Install as a Rails 3 Gem:

  $: vim Gemfile

    group :development do
      gem "rcov_rails"
    end

  $: bundle install
  $: rake test:coverage # boom!

Install as a Rails 2.x Plugin:
  
  $: sudo gem install rcov
  $: ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/matthewrudy/rcov_rails
  $: rake test:coverage # boom!
  
Install as a Rails 3.x Plugin: // I suggest you don't do this, as you'll need to add rcov via bundler anyway

  $: sudo gem install rcov
  $: vim Gemfile

    group :development do
      gem "rcov"
    end

  $: bundle install
  $: rails plugin install git://github.com/matthewrudy/rcov_rails
  $: rake test:coverage # boom!
